        An almond-studded crust supports layer upon layer of flavor. There's
        apricot folded into the cheesecake mixture, a layer of sweetened sour
        cream over that, and a layer of apricot glaze to finish it off. You
        could push it one step further and top it with whipped cream with a
        touch of almond extract instead of vanilla.

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch
        springform pan with parchment paper.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <p>
        For the crust, combine almond flour, brown sugar, and almonds in a bowl.
        Add butter and stir with a fork until mixture resembles wet sand. Spread
        evenly in the pan. Set aside.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 3</h4>
      <p>
        For the cheesecake, combine apricots and enough water to cover in a
        saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer
        until very soft, about 10 minutes. Drain and mash into pulp. Add
        amaretto and sugar to taste. Mix until well combined.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 4</h4>
      <p>
        Beat cream cheese, 3/4 cup white sugar, sour cream, cornstarch, and
        vanilla extract in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Add eggs
        one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Fold in 2 tablespoons of
        apricot pulp (reserve remainder for garnish). Pour cheesecake batter
        into the pan.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 5</h4>
      <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface is firm
        except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is
        gently shaken, about 45 minutes.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 6</h4>
      <p>
        For the topping, beat sour cream, sugar, and vanilla extract together
        until combined. Remove cheesecake from the oven. Spoon topping over
        surface of cake and continue to bake, 8 minutes more.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 7</h4>
      <p>
        Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours.
        Top with remaining apricot pulp before serving.
